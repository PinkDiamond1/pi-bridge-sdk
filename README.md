  <h1> Pi-Bridge SDK </h1>
</div>

 
The Pi-Bridge-SDK is a framework for building blockchain applications in Golang based on [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk). It is being used to build [Pi-Bridge](https://github.com/pchain-org/pi-bridge), the first implementation of the Pi-Bridge Hub.

**WARNING**: The SDK has mostly stabilized, but we are still making some
breaking changes.

**Note**: Requires [Go 1.15+](https://golang.org/dl/)

## Quick Start

To learn how the SDK works from a high-level perspective, go to the [SDK Intro](./docs/intro/overview.md).

For more, please go to the [Pi-Bridge SDK Docs](./docs/).
